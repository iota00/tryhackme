# Tmux

* tmux, the terminal multiplexer, is easily one of the most used tools by the Linux community (and not just pentesters!).
* While not a malicious tool, tmux makes running simultaneous tasks throughout a pentest incredibly easy.
* In this primer room, we'll walk through the process of installing and using some of the most common key combinations used in tmux.

> Note, the installation process in this is geared towards Kali/Ubuntu.

1. installation

```bash
apt-get install tmux
```

2. What command do we use to launch a new session without a custom name?

```
tmux
```

3. All tmux commands start with a keyboard button combination. What is the first key in this combination?

```
Control
```

4. How about the second key? Note, these keys must be pressed at the same time and released before pressing the next target key in the combination. 

```
B
```

5. Lets go ahead and detach from our newly created tmux session. What key do we need to add to the combo in order to detach?

```
D
```

6. Well shoot, we've detached from our session. How do we list all of our sessions?

```bash
apt-get install tmux
```

7. What did our session name default to when we created one without a set name?

```bash
apt-get install tmux
```

8. Now that we've found the name of our session, how do we attach to it?

```bash
apt-get install tmux
```

9. Whew! Plenty of output to work with now! If you work with a relatively small terminal like me, this output might not all fit on screen at once. To fix that, let's enter 'copy mode'. What key do we add to the combo to enter copy mode?

```bash
apt-get install tmux
```

10. Copy mode is very similar to 'less' and allows up to scroll up and down using the arrow keys. What if we want to go up to the very top?

```bash
apt-get install tmux
```

11. How about the bottom?

```bash
apt-get install tmux
```

12. What key do we press to exit 'copy mode'?

```bash
apt-get install tmux
```

13. This window we're working in is nice and all but I think we need an upgrade. What key do we add to the combo to split the window vertically?

```bash
apt-get install tmux
```

14. How about horizontally?

```bash
apt-get install tmux
```

15. Say one of these newly minted panes becomes unresponsive or we're just done working in it, what key do we add to the combo to 'kill' the pane?

```bash
apt-get install tmux
```
16. Now that's we've finished out work, what can we type to close the session?

```bash
apt-get install tmux
```

17. Last but not least, how do we spawn a named tmux session named 'neat'?

```bash
apt-get install tmux
```
